          <p>It never occurred to me that when I started this journey of learning Python that I would also be developing my first website. Web development was never on my radar. Yet now I understand the importance of front-end web development. It may look simple but under the hood there is a level of sophistication that clearly is not as straightforward as it may seem. I am excited to go over the basics of what keeps this website online.</p>

        <p>I am using a Flask framework and Python to code the website on the back-end. As you can see the Python file is relatively light with under 30 lines of code. The beauty of Flask is how powerful it can be with a small amount of code. I was able to route the index file, which is the main html file, and then connect them all with the other html files. In turn allowing visitors to move flawlessly throughout the pages with elegance and ease when browsing the website. Additionally visitors not only get to view my content but can provide their contact information via the website's submit form function. Creating data which then can be organized and managed as a csv file. My database can record inputs on a server which allows me to later analyze and respond to inquiries. Python is truly an elegant way of creating a website as you can see. It might even give JavaScript a run for its money in the ease of use department.</p>

        <p>The development environment is one of most crucial parts of producing a viable product. I still recall the first time I was had to set up a development environment, it felt like a mission to get all the right components to function cohesively. For instance I was initially intimidated by the complexity of the terminal, but I soon realized that the terminal simplified the development process by connecting all the building blocks. The terminal ran the local servers on my computer, installed, updated and secured dependencies for the site. I was able to debug my website in real-time, without the need of integrated development environment! This meant that my website would be simple and light once deployed. Additionally I didn’t have to pivot between reconnecting, coding and updating the server to make any changes to the website. Overall this approach came in handy when I started to edit the front-end side of the website's HTML, CSS or JavaScript. I was able to visualize the website and iron out any bugs as they occurred.</p>

        <img src="./static/assets/images/web/html.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">
        <p>Once the environment was deployed I was able to build the front-end of the website. I started to create and interact with the HTML and CSS files to control certain visualize aspects of the website which included the navigation bars, font styles, font sizes, images, and other properties. I familiarized myself with the tags and syntax style of HTML and CSS. Understanding HTML tags was pretty straightforward, they resemble the structure of a canvas. CSS syntax on the other hand resembled more of brush, brackets style, that allows the browser engine to paint on the elements of the page with specific features like colors, positions and decorations. JavaScript in this project acted more of scripting component to implement complex web features. JavaScript can be used solely with other frameworks such as React but for this project I wanted to keep it Python based with a Flask framework. </p>

        <p>Since my main focus was on Python, in order to make up for my lack of knowledge in the web development process I relied heavily on the official documentation of the respective languages. Additionally I used Stack Overflow to comprehend and troubleshoot any errors that I came across in the development process. I tackled every challenge head-on and problem-solved every aspect of the project. I holistically used this approach to iron out major bugs that tried to hinder my vision for the finished website. Every day working on this website was a challenge but also a perfect learning opportunity to learn new web development concepts. In the end the effort and time invested in the web development process allowed to create the finished website you see today.</p>

        <p>I truly enjoyed buliding my first website from scratch! It tested my understanding of concepts and how they function together to bring a website to life. I initially got interested in the back-end development of Python but then faced an obstacle in which I had no avenue for presenting my current and future projects. I had to face front-end development head-on if I wanted to create a space for my projects. It was with this determination and tenacity that I committed to learning front-end development and its languages. Bringing all these tools together, languages, and frameworks with Python opened my understanding to the principles of web development. I personally understand that I still have a lot to learn about computer science but this project marks a mojor milestone towards a larger world of computation. I am continually seeking knowledge, learning and bring new ideas to life. I look forward to building more projects that can change the way we think of technology. I am excited to have embarked on this intellectual endeavor.</p>
